### Goals to be written as user stories
Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some
of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you,
just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images.

### Stretch goals to be written as user stories
Using the Canvas API, create a fun graphic or animation to play at the end of a survey so a user feels
celebrated and appreciated.
